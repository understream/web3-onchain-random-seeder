# web3-onchain-random-seeder
A seed generator on chain by every one, for every one, to every one.

This is a simple project for those who need a random number for their on chain Web3 projects.

Don't deploy this project your own, just use the deployed ones directly (see contracts/Demo.sol), there's no extra fee.

The system is simple -- that the more people using, the safer, 
which means that it would be more difficult to manipulate or to predict the next random number it generates.
